[DirtCow](https://dirtycow.ninja/)
[Details of the vuln](https://github.com/dirtycow/dirtycow.github.io/wiki/VulnerabilityDetails)


> Dirty COW was a vulnerability in the Linux kernel. It allowed processes to write to read-only files. This exploit made use of a race condition that lived inside the kernel functions which handle the copy-on-write (COW) feature of memory mappings. An example use case includes over-writing a user's UID in /etc/passwd to gain root privileges. Dirty COW is listed in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures as CVE-2016-5195.
> The vulnerability had existed in the Linux kernel since 2007. It was discovered and partially patched in 2016 (and fully patched in 2017).

We can then use the script in `scripts/writeup2/dirtycow.c`
